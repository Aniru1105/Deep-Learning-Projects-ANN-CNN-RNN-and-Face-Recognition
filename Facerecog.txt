Face Recognition System with CNN and OpenCV

1. Introduction:
Face recognition combines computer vision and deep learning to detect and identify human faces. It involves preprocessing images, extracting facial features, and classifying them into identities. Real-time systems require integration with OpenCV for video capture and image handling.

2. Architecture:
- Preprocessing:
  Converted images to grayscale, normalized pixel values, resized inputs for model compatibility.
- Convolutional Neural Network:
  Extracted hierarchical facial features (edges, eyes, nose, mouth patterns).
- Dense Layers:
  Mapped extracted features to individual identities.
- Output Layer:
  Softmax activation function for multi-class face recognition.
- Integration:
  OpenCV used for real-time video stream processing and face detection.

3. Workflow:
- Dataset:
  Organized labeled images of different individuals.
- Model Construction:
  Trained CNN model on face dataset.
- Real-Time Recognition:
  Used Haar cascades / DNN face detectors with OpenCV to detect faces and pass them to CNN for recognition.
- Evaluation:
  Measured recognition accuracy and tested in real-time video scenarios.

4. Applications:
- Security authentication (biometric login).
- Attendance systems.
- Surveillance and monitoring.
- Social media tagging.

5. Results:
The face recognition project successfully identified and distinguished faces in real time with strong accuracy, proving effectiveness in practical computer vision tasks.
