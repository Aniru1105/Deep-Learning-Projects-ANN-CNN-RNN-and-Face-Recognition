Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

1. Introduction:
Artificial Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs, apply transformations, and generate outputs. ANNs are foundational in supervised learning for classification and regression problems.

2. Architecture:
- Input Layer:
  Accepts raw features (e.g., customer attributes, sensor readings, tabular data).
- Hidden Layers:
  Multiple dense (fully connected) layers with nonlinear activation functions like ReLU to learn complex patterns.
- Dropout Layers:
  Regularization technique that randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training to reduce overfitting.
- Output Layer:
  Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification or softmax for multi-class classification.

3. Workflow:
- Data Preprocessing:
  Structured datasets are cleaned, normalized, and converted into numerical form.
- Model Building:
  Defined a Sequential model using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple dense layers.
- Training:
  Optimized with Adam optimizer and backpropagation.
- Evaluation:
  Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and visualized loss/accuracy curves.

4. Applications:
- Predicting customer churn.
- Credit scoring and fraud detection.
- Disease diagnosis from structured health records.

5. Results:
The ANN project successfully classified structured datasets with high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of feedforward networks in solving supervised learning problems.
