Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM

1. Introduction:
Recurrent Neural Networks are designed for sequential data, where the current output depends not only on the current input but also on previous inputs. Standard RNNs face vanishing/exploding gradient issues for long sequences, so Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to retain information over longer periods.

2. Architecture:
- Input Sequences:
  Sequential datasets such as stock prices, natural language, or signals.
- LSTM Layers:
  Each LSTM cell has three gates (input, forget, and output) that control the flow of information and memory retention.
- Dropout Layers:
  Reduce overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
- Dense Output Layer:
  Generates the final prediction (regression for continuous values or classification for sequence labels).

3. Workflow:
- Data Preprocessing:
  Scaled data using MinMaxScaler, generated sequences (e.g., 60 timesteps â†’ 1 output).
- Model Construction:
  Built LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras with stacked layers.
- Training:
  Optimized with Adam optimizer and trained over multiple epochs.
- Evaluation:
  Compared predicted vs. actual values using RMSE, plotted graphs for trends.

4. Applications:
- Stock market prediction.
- Weather forecasting.
- Natural language processing (sentiment analysis, translation).
- Speech recognition.

5. Results:
The RNN with LSTM project delivered accurate time-series forecasting, proving its capability in capturing temporal dependencies and predicting trends with minimal error.
