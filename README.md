# Deep-Learning-Projects-ANN-CNN-RNN-and-Face-Recognition
This repository contains multiple deep learning projects implemented using **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV**.   The projects demonstrate applications of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN with LSTM), and real-time Face Recognition.
